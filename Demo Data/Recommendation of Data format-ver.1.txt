Guidance of Visualization-plot: 
Demo data isn't real data, and it just make users understand the format of inputting data.  

File type: .csv

1.Make sure your package is latest on running shiny program.
2.Make sure your group number of drugs.
3.Make sure your replicated number of each group.

The format of inputting data must be same with the format of demo data. The columns of input data have two label columns and column of main dataset, 
the first label column is known ID of drug, which needs to include internal standard drug, second label column is sequence number.
